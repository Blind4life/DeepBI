If there is a need for the above environment locally

- Redis can be accessed directly through the 127.0.0.1 password-free command line.
- Python version requirements 3.8+ Recommend using virtual environments such as pyenv coda
postgresql needs to install postgresql-16 version
- Just run . ubuntu_install.sh directly (note that you run . ubuntu_CN_install.sh instead of sh xxx here, because you need to run the python virtual environment)
